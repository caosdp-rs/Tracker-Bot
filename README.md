# Tracker-Bot
**FIFA Ultimate Team** is my *ultimate* guilty pleasure. Its transfer market is as captivating as the stock market, if not more. I built a **bot** that **tracks** player price fluctuation on [FUTBIN](https://www.futbin.com/), **locates** and **retrieves** price data as string, converts data type to float. Performs a comparison check to the price point set by the user. Takes **screenshots, attaches** image and price data to an **email** sent to user(s). The script also runs on a **scheduler**. Time, player and email are set by the user. **Utilized Python, Selenium, smtplib, MIMEMultipart, MIMEImage, MIMEText and schedule.**
